## Report Structure

### Executive Summary

**Key Components:**
- **Patient Information**: Sample identifier and analysis date
- **Critical Findings**: High-priority pharmacogenomic results
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Clinical actions to consider
- **Risk Assessment**: Overall risk profile for drug metabolism

**Example:**
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

Patient ID: SAMPLE_001
Analysis Date: 2024-01-15
Reference Genome: GRCh38

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- CYP2D6: Poor Metabolizer (*4/*4)
- CYP2C19: Intermediate Metabolizer (*1/*2)
- TPMT: Normal Metabolizer (*1/*1)

ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid codeine and tramadol (CYP2D6 poor metabolizer)
- Consider reduced dosing for clopidogrel (CYP2C19 intermediate)
- Standard dosing appropriate for azathioprine (TPMT normal)
```

### Gene Analysis Section

**For Each Pharmacogene:**
- **Diplotype**: Star allele combination (e.g., *1/*2)
- **Phenotype**: Functional classification (e.g., Intermediate Metabolizer)
- **Activity Score**: Quantitative measure of enzyme activity
- **Clinical Significance**: Impact on drug metabolism
- **Drug Interactions**: Affected medications
- **Recommendations**: Specific dosing guidance

**Example Gene Entry:**
```
CYP2D6 Analysis
===============

Diplotype: *4/*4
Phenotype: Poor Metabolizer
Activity Score: 0.0
Confidence: High

Clinical Significance:
- Significantly reduced enzyme activity
- Increased risk of adverse effects with standard dosing
- May require alternative medications

Affected Drugs:
- Codeine: Avoid (increased risk of toxicity)
- Tramadol: Avoid (increased risk of toxicity)
- Metoprolol: Consider reduced dosing
- Fluoxetine: Consider reduced dosing

Recommendations:
- Avoid codeine and tramadol
- Use alternative analgesics
- Consider reduced dosing for other CYP2D6 substrates
- Monitor for adverse effects
```

## Understanding Star Alleles

### Star Allele Notation

**Format**: `*1/*2` (diplotype) or `*1` (haplotype)

**Common Alleles:**
- **`*1`**: Reference (wild-type) allele
- **`*2`, `*3`, `*4`, etc.**: Variant alleles
- **`*N`**: Novel or undefined alleles
- **`*`**: No call or failed analysis

**Examples:**
- `*1/*1`: Homozygous reference (normal metabolizer)
- `*1/*2`: Heterozygous variant (intermediate metabolizer)
- `*2/*2`: Homozygous variant (poor metabolizer)
- `*1/*17`: Duplication (ultrarapid metabolizer)

### Phenotype Classifications

**Normal Metabolizer (NM):**
- Standard enzyme activity
- Normal drug processing
- Standard dosing appropriate

**Intermediate Metabolizer (IM):**
- Reduced enzyme activity
- Slower drug processing
- May require dose adjustment

**Poor Metabolizer (PM):**
- Significantly reduced activity
- Very slow drug processing
- Often requires alternative medications

**Rapid Metabolizer (RM):**
- Increased enzyme activity
- Faster drug processing
- May require higher doses

**Ultrarapid Metabolizer (UM):**
- Very high enzyme activity
- Very fast drug processing
- Often requires alternative medications

## Clinical Recommendations

### Recommendation Levels

**Green (No Action):**
- Standard dosing appropriate
- No special monitoring required
- Normal drug response expected

**Yellow (Consider Alternative):**
- Consider dose adjustment
- Monitor for efficacy/adverse effects
- May require alternative medications

**Red (Avoid or Extreme Caution):**
- Avoid medication if possible
- Use only with extreme caution
- Consider alternative treatments

**Blue (Additional Monitoring):**
- Standard dosing may be appropriate
- Monitor closely for effects
- Consider therapeutic drug monitoring

### CPIC Guidelines

**Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guidelines:**
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Regularly updated with new evidence
- Graded by strength of evidence
- Specific to gene-drug pairs

**Guideline Levels:**
- **Level 1A**: Strong evidence, high confidence
- **Level 1B**: Strong evidence, moderate confidence
- **Level 2A**: Moderate evidence, high confidence
- **Level 2B**: Moderate evidence, moderate confidence
- **Level 3**: Weak evidence, low confidence

## Quality Metrics

### Confidence Scores

**High Confidence (≥90%):**
- Strong evidence for genotype
- Multiple supporting variants
- High-quality sequencing data

**Moderate Confidence (70-89%):**
- Good evidence for genotype
- Some supporting variants
- Good-quality sequencing data

**Low Confidence (<70%):**
- Weak evidence for genotype
- Few supporting variants
- Poor-quality sequencing data

### Coverage Information

**Coverage Depth:**
- **High Coverage (≥30x)**: Reliable genotype calls
- **Medium Coverage (10-29x)**: Generally reliable
- **Low Coverage (<10x)**: May be unreliable

**Coverage Breadth:**
