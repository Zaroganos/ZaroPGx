# ZaroPGx Project Progress

## Overview
ZaroPGx is a pharmacogenomics analysis platform using Docker-based microservices architecture. The system processes genetic data (VCF files) to generate personalized medication recommendations based on patient genotypes.

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: End-to-end implementation and testing
- **Last Updated**: March 28, 2025

| **API Endpoints** | 游릭 Working | REST API for service interactions | API documentation accessible at /docs |
| **Web UI** | 游릭 Working | User-friendly interface | Simple Bootstrap UI for file uploads |

## Recent Changes

1. **Major Achievement**: Completed end-to-end integration:
   - Successfully connected web UI file upload to backend services
   - Integrated PharmCAT and Aldy services for genotype calling
   - Implemented PDF report generation with WeasyPrint
   - Added HTML fallback for reports if PDF generation fails

2. **Service Integration Fixes**:
   - Fixed service connection issues between main app and PharmCAT wrapper
   - Updated PharmCAT wrapper to use /genotype endpoint for processing
   - Fixed URL naming in Docker Compose networking
   - Properly passed environment variables between containers

3. **Report Generation Implementation**:
   - Created PDF report template with clean styling
   - Implemented interactive HTML report with visualizations
   - Added proper error handling for PDF generation
   - Created fallback mechanisms for report generation errors
   
4. **Sample Data Integration**:
   - Added sample VCF files for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genes
   - Created test data for verifying the pipeline
   - Implemented VCF upload and processing workflow

5. **Major Update**: Added user-friendly web interface:
   - Created Bootstrap-based web UI
   - Added file upload form for VCF processing
   - Added service status display
   - Implemented Jinja2 templates in FastAPI

6. **Critical Fix**: Resolved issues with PharmCAT and Aldy services:
   - Updated PharmCAT to use simple command to keep container running
   - Added proper Gunicorn server for Aldy service
   - Fixed container restart issues for both services
   - All services now running healthily

## Current Challenges

1. **SNP Coverage**: Current implementation only processes a limited set of SNPs:
   - Need to expand coverage for more comprehensive PGx analysis
   - Include additional CYP genes beyond CYP2D6 and CYP2C19
   - Integrate more drug-gene interaction data from CPIC

2. **System Robustness**:
   - Strengthen error handling for edge cases
   - Add comprehensive input validation for file uploads
   - Implement better monitoring and logging

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Complete integration with PostgreSQL for storing results
   - Implement proper patient data storage and retrieval

## Upcoming Tasks

1. **Extended SNP Coverage**: Add support for additional pharmacogenomic variants
   
2. **Database Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema for CPIC guidelines

3. **Report Enhancements**: Improve report visualizations and add more clinical context

4. **API Documentation**: Complete Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all services

5. **Testing Scripts**: Create testing scripts to verify end-to-end functionality

6. **User Management**: Implement proper user management system
