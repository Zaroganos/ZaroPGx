### Visualizations

This folder contains architecture and workflow diagrams for ZaroPGx.

- `workflow.md`: Mermaid diagram of the end-to-end processing pipeline (upload → processing → reporting → optional FHIR export).
- `workflow.mmd`: The sophisticated Mermaid template used by the application for generating workflow diagrams in reports.

Render options
- GitHub renders Mermaid natively. For local preview, use VS Code with a Mermaid preview extension or paste the diagram into an online Mermaid editor.
- Images are generated by the app at report time using Kroki (no local setup needed). See `workflow_diagram.py`.

The workflow diagrams are now consolidated in this single location within the app structure for better organization.
