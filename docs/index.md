## What is ZaroPGx?

ZaroPGx is a self-hosted, containerized platform that:

- **Processes genomic data** (VCF, BAM, CRAM, FASTQ) using industry-standard tools
- **Performs comprehensive allele calling** across 23+ pharmacogenes using PharmCAT, PyPGx, and OptiType
- **Generates clinical reports** with actionable pharmacogenomic recommendations
- **Maintains data privacy** through local deployment with no external data transmission
- **Integrates with EHR systems** via FHIR export capabilities

The platform orchestrates multiple bioinformatics tools through Docker containers, providing a unified interface for pharmacogenomic analysis that would typically require extensive command-line expertise.
